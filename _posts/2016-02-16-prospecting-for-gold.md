This is my original initial set I purchased in order to get started in panning for gold. I have plans to make additional purchases in the near future. I don't like the mini classifiers that came with the set, so I plan to buy ones that cover the pan and five gallon buckets.

I plan to invest in the following items:

1\. Turbopan: [http://www.turbopan.com][0]

2\. X Stream Pro: [http://www.gold-n-sand.com/\#/x-stream-pro/4578344545 ][1]
